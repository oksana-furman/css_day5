            <p>I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've
                never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>I've never known anyone who was what he or she seemed; or at least, was only what he or she seemed. People carry worlds within them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>Write your story as it needs to be written. Write it honestly, and tell it as best you can. I'm not sure that there are any other rules. Not ones that matter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>Sometimes the best way to learn something is by doing it wrong and looking at what you did.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>The one thing that you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision. So write and draw and build and play and dance and live as only you can.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>The imagination is a muscle. If it is not exercised, it atrophies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>Empathy is a tool for building people into groups, for allowing us to function as more than self-obsessed individuals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>Life - and I don't suppose I'm the first to make this comparison - is a disease: sexually transmitted, and invariably fatal.</p>
